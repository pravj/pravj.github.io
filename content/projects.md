  <p>Projects, out of thin air.</p>

I nurture my secret chores in the <b>~/projects/</b> directory. If you want to see all of my projects that managed to get out of that directory, you can head over to my <a href="https://github.com/pravj">GitHub</a>.

        <p>How many UBER cars are there around you, 5 to 7? How many such cars are there in your city right now?</p>
	<p>Yeah, these questions are interesting. So, I spent some time solving them and you can read the journey in my post <a href="http://hackpravj.com/blog/bangalore-taxis/">Jump in to ride all the Bangalore taxis, at once.</a></p>
	<p>I started with devising a way to collect the information while trying my best to not get caught. Once I had the data, rest is all intuitions.</p>
	<p>The report contains some engaging things like the 'geological mapping of the cabs', 'timeline when the probability of finding a cab is higher' and 'activity of a particular taxi throughout the day' etc.</p>

	<p>This summer I worked with Myntra as a Software Development Intern. Yes, the same service that went mobile app only.</p>
	<p>Before this, I have never used a smartphone, so I wasn't very well aware about the mobile boom, hence Java and Android Development weren't my mates.</p>
	<p>I worked with the Mobile Engineering team there, and worked on a Collaborative shopping focused chat service. It allows you to form chat groups and share Myntra products as well as text and image messages, with the group participants.</p>
	<p>Powered with push notification for mentions, typing indicators, rich message content and whatever we see in a general chat application, it was a real fun and learning experience.</p>

	<p> Puzzl is an advance version of the classical sliding puzzle game, built with Go, to be played in terminals. If you want to read, I have also written an article about its development, <a target="_blank" title="puzzl story" href="http://hackpravj.com/blog/development-story-of-puzzl/">Development story of the puzzl</a>. </p>
	<p> When I got the wave to work on it, my main motive was to play with the Goroutines and Channels in Go. Later I got a secret inspiration to work on it, and I ended up completing it in a format, which was good looking, at least to me. </p>
	<p> I have also written a paper on it, which is on the arXiv by Cornell University. </p>

	<p>Open Source Presence Infographic of Indian Startups, abbreviated OSPI, is one of my favorite project. I worked on it during one of my winter vacations when I was getting bored at home. You better read the article for it, <a target="_blank" title="OSPI" href="http://hackpravj.com/blog/open-source-presence-infographic/">Open Source Presence Infographic of Indian Startups</a>.</p>
	<p> I started working on it after reading an interview of the Flipkart CTO, Amod Malviya. In this report you can see the evolution of the Open Source community in the Indian startup ecosystem. </p>
	<p> It has some nice visualizations marking their opinion, so nice that now I have no idea, how did I come up with them. </p>
	<p> OSPI earned some massive attention on the Holy Internet, and I got to interact with some inspiring people because of this. </p>
	<p> Awesome folks at <i>Wingify</i> have written a blog post mentioning it.</p>

	<p> geopattern was my first ever Go project, I worked on it because I was asked to learn Go by the <a target="_blank" title="Datadog" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a> CEO, Olivier Pomel. And you know, vacations are the best time to learn something new, so I stayed in the institute during my Diwali vacations and completed it. </p>
	<p> Like all other projects of mine, I have an article for the geopattern development also. You can read it here, <a target="_blank" title="geopattern" href="http://hackpravj.com/blog/going-on-the-go-path/">geo_pattern &#58; going on the Go path</a>. </p>
	<p> I was lucky enough to see it ranking <b>#2 on Hacker News</b>. A <i>dream-come-true</i> moment. </p>

	<p> Working on the <i>Doga</i> was one of the best things to me, I still remember that week. </p>
<p> <i>Doga</i> was the assignment given to me for an intern position at <a target="_blank" title="Datadog" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>. Without continuing the mistery, I got the internship offer after it. Although I got unlucky later, and unable to get through the visa process, so had to leave the internship. </p>

	<p> <i>teamwork</i> was the first Data related big thing of mine, I had this pinch to work on something in the GitHub Data Challenge, and the dream got completed with the <i>teamwork</i>. </p>
<p> I worked on it with one of my friend <i>Nairitya Khilari</i>, although it wasn't the logic behing its nomenclature. </p>
<p> <i>teamwork</i> was a dashboard for organizations on GitHub, where you can see analytics that you don't get to see in general. It had a aggregated <i>GitHub Contribution Calendar</i>, per user contribution to the organization, member and repository based leaderboards and similar features. </p>

	<p> All this started when I was figuring out a way to <i>reverse map</i> default user avatars on GitHub. Those avatars are images, that looks like a 5x5 matrix, symmetric along the vertical axis. For example, check this out for my username, <a target="_blank" title="GitHub Identicon" href="https://github.com/identicons/pravj.png">pravj</a>. </p>
<p> Later I realised that I can devise a better implementation, that improves the <i>collision resistance</i> of the generated images. </p>
<p> For the new version, I ended up using the color palette that we see in the GitHub's contribution calendar. It uses some nice mathematical arrangements to improve the results. </p>
<p> Take a look at <a target="_blank" title="Penticons the hash game" href="/blog/penticons-the-hash-game/">Introducing Penticons &#58; The Hash Game</a> for the development story of Penticons. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/penticons" title="Penticons">Penticons</a> hosts all the implementations of it in different programming languages. </p>

		<p class="tech-stack">Golang, GopherGala, Hackathon, Y Combinator</p>
	<p> It was cold January of 2015, people were tweeting about the first ever Gopher Gala. And there is no second thought on my love for the language. So I managed to form a team with two of my friends and started looking for an idea. </p>
<p> As I had no experience in developing a web application with Go, before the event, I worked on a sample application to learn the Beego framework. You can have a look at the application here, <a target="_blank" title="beehub" href="https://github.com/Gomob/beehub">beehub</a>, it was a GitHub Oauth application in Beego. </p>
<p> Hackman was supposed to have features that would solve all the problems, right from the creating a hackathon, publising it and finilising the results. During the event, I talked with one of the Gopher Gala organizer and he loved the idea, he even asked us to add some additional features. </p>
<p> Although we weren't able to complete the entire thing in the small time period of the hackathon, later we also <i>dreamed</i> of having Hackman as a Y Combinator company. </p>
