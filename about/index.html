  In college, long before I had a job title, I was the kind of person who coded for fun.

  I am based out of Bangalore, where I live with <span style="background-color: #fce7f3; padding: 0.1em 0.2em;">my wife</span> <s>and a dog</s> (<span style="background-color: #fef9c3; padding: 0.1em 0.2em;">not really! I haven't been able to convince her on this</span>).

<span style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="background-color: #fce7f3; padding: 0.1em 0.2em;">Photography</span> has been a constant companion since I got my first ever smartphone. Recently, I upgraded to my first proper camera — <span style="background-color: #dbeafe; padding: 0.1em 0.2em;">Canon R100</span> — though I suppose that depends on whether you count point-and-shoot cameras as 'proper.' (Check <a href="/photos">Photos</a>)
</span>
</br>
<p>In addition to a fast fading love for Cricket, I have a somewhat unusual sporting interest: <span style="background-color: #fce7f3; padding: 0.1em 0.2em;">Polo</span>. I love watching it, and one day I want to try my hand at it. The last three generations of my family have played as recorded, so I&rsquo;m hoping some of that might have rubbed off on me.</p>
<p>Other than that, I like collecting proverb and using them in daily life. I&rsquo;ve recently recovered from Stage-IV Tsundoku and trying to get better at <span style="background-color: #fef9c3; padding: 0.1em 0.2em;">adulting</span> in general.</p>
