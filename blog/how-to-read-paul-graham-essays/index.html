Yes. Take my “personal” answer/solution to this question for example.
Looking in the past, most of the time I’ve found myself reading the essays when I’m sitting in MTR on my own trying to spend some time off, amidst the constant background noise of people ordering the same three items over and over." />

        <p>Before you start reading this piece, I want to inform that the question presented here is equivalent to a mathematical problem that has multiple possible answers. The answer depends on you; how do you arrive on one of his articles, and what are you seeking.</p>
<p>Sounds like a zen proverb, right?</p>
<p>Yes. Take my “personal” answer/solution to this question for example.</p>
<p>Looking in the past, most of the time I’ve found myself reading the essays when I’m sitting in MTR on my own trying to spend some time off, amidst the constant background noise of people ordering the same three items over and over.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly where I found this question.</p>
<p>I was wondering if they can be presented in a manner that is relevant to some readers. In this article, I&rsquo;ve collated the essays into <strong>five different categories</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>### A. Chronological order
This one is easy. You can just go to the [essays section](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) of his website and start from the very first essay he wrote. Obviously, You will have to scroll to the end.

### B. Favorite picks by Paul
Paul has shared a list of his favorite essays on Twitter. You can find the listing [here](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1207995301535080449?lang=en).

&gt; If you don't want to visit Twitter, [here is a public Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjlaRr-mjVycnY9ArG7v5cLjmJIfnTxOlF0O5U8cLZs/edit#gid=1578787862&amp;range=A1:B1) that contains the favorite essays.

### C. Most talked about on the Internet
Here are some of the top performing articles in terms of backlinks (based on a free MOZ report).
* [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)
* [Why Nerds are Unpopular](www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)
* [Beating the Averages](www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)
* [Do Things that Don't Scale](www.paulgraham.com/ds.html)
* [A Plan for Spam](www.paulgraham.com/spam.html)
* [Startup = Growth](www.paulgraham.com/growth.html)
* [Great Hackers](www.paulgraham.com/gh.html)

### D. Most referred in his own essays
The essays build on each other so well, that you can see the wisdom being laid out in front of you. You are reading essay A and it has a subtle mention to the essay B.

Here is the list of top-10 essay based on their reference-authority (PageRank) in all other essays by Paul.
* [Beating the Averages](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)
* [Lisp for Web-Based Applications](http://www.paulgraham.com/lwba.html)
* [What You Can't Say](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html)
* [Revenge of the Nerds](http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html)
* [The Roots of Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html)
* [What Made Lisp Different](http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html)
* [The Age of the Essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html)

* [Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)
* [Great Hackers](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html)

&gt; If you want to read all of them in an organised manner as per the Bloom's taxonomy, [here is a public Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjlaRr-mjVycnY9ArG7v5cLjmJIfnTxOlF0O5U8cLZs/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A1:B1) that contains them in the proper order.

### E. Topic-wise directory of the essays
The essays generally touch multiple aspects of life. It's common to find a general life-advice hidden somewhere in a programming essay.
And this makes it complex to precisely categorize the essays, but I've made an attempt to achieve the same.

There are ten categories listed here, along with the top-3 articles from that category. Please be mindful that the classification was done using a generic model, and it might have given wrong result in some case. If you encounter any wrong categorization, please let me know.

&gt; If you want to access categorization for all the essays, [here is a public Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjlaRr-mjVycnY9ArG7v5cLjmJIfnTxOlF0O5U8cLZs/edit#gid=905287736&amp;range=A1:C1) for you.

### Build your own version
You can’t deny the fact that the essays are extremely relatable if you’re somewhat close to startups. They give the feeling of a favourite book or movie that you just keeps giving, and you still feel there is something that you’ve missed.

It seems like you can find everything there. Some of the articles are underrated too, and it brings a different feeling when you read them. I’ve used them to [design better survey or interview questions](http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html), to [learn from others](http://www.paulgraham.com/copy.html), and much more.

Go ahead and find a sequence which is unique to you.</code></pre>
