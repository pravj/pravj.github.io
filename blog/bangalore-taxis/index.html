    <div class="container post-content" style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;">
      <p>All right, just imagine that you have popcorn with you, because I know that you don&#39;t have.</p>

<p>I decided to do this report when I was in Bangalore this summer, <em>Sillicon Valley of India</em>. You can observe a gob of information flowing through in such metropolitan population. People ordering/delivering meal, groceries or literally everything by online orders, people booking a vehicle and riding in no time, people booking a seat for dinner/movie and many more thing to generate the logs. Which is fascinating.</p>

<p>One day while riding a cab, I got this plan to go into the rectangle map the app was showing, and run around. Just like what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKCIMX2dsEc">Joey did in an episode of Friends</a>.</p>

<p>To execute this all, I had to collect the relavent information and work on the possible outcomes of the collected information.</p>

<p>Here in this post I have written the procedure I followed, things I have feared of, interesting results I saw and count of tea cups I have sipped.</p>

<h3>The brick wall</h3>

<p>A little more theory and then we will get right to the practicals.</p>

<p>While setting up the collection infrastucture, I realised that I might be under the <em>terms and services</em> monster. This suspicion helped me lading in the depression zone where I wasn&#39;t sure if the work I have done so far was worth doing or not.</p>

<p>I thought about asking the respective organization for a permission but I was too afraid to hear a negative reply. So I went ahead and ignored this. Because this report does not publicize any private property like vehicle numbers, mobile numbers and all. Even I wasn&#39;t able to access such private properties.</p>

<p>The major reason was, I have already bunked too many classes for this, so terminating the work wasn&#39;t an option.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware that it&#39;s a wrong act but I couldn&#39;t stop the <em>David McCandless</em> inside me from doing this. I hope I&#39;m not getting sued for this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This report is based on the data from a particular taxi service in a single day&#39;s time span, so it may be a little baised.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Information Retrieval</h3>

<p>Collecting the right information was the foundation for the whole game. Possibility of getting blocked was also there, once you come under the <em>Night&#39;s watch</em>.</p>

<p>The task reduces to finding <em>how many taxis are there in the city</em> (at a time), <em>where they are</em> and then keep doing this all the day <em>without getting caught</em>. Easy Peasy?</p>

<p>I came up with the solution to find places in the city which are equally seperated and then drawing circles on those points would cover the entire city. A fake <em>cab search request</em> would return us the status of cabs around that place.</p>

<p>For that I planned to start from the center of the city, iterate this on adjacent places using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">Finite State Machine</a> to stay aware of the ending state (when we are done with all such place-combinations) and state changes (when we are out of the city&#39;s boundary in a particular direction).</p>

<p>While writing the FSM, I found an efficient alternative to iterate over all the equally separated places which comes under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_rectangle">Minimum Bounding Rectangle</a> of Bangalore, and check if the cab service is available in that area or not.</p>

<p>Equally spacing those spots minimizes the total number of requests made, which descreases the chances of getting blocked, <em>if there is such service on the other side</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bangalore-taxis/point-net.png" alt="point-net" title="Equally separated places"></p>

<p>Once all those places were spotted, I made a <em>cab search request</em> on all those spots every 15 minutes. I think it&#39;s a bit more time than the <em>average trip duration</em>.</p>

<p>Later I realised a mistake that I have forgot to count the time making requests to all the places, so the separation went up to almost 19 minutes.</p>

<p>I continuously pumped all those responses to a <a href="http://www.iron.io/mq/">IronMQ</a> powered message queue and then imported all the data into a local <a href="http://rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a> instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One should try not to hit the source at a constant timeperiod (like 15 minutes in this case), because that&#39;s the basic heuristic for smart <em>bot detection</em> systems. I had to do that because it was needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Service Availability</h3>

<p>In the <em>Minimum Bounding Rectangle</em>, I found a total of 272 spots but only 96 of them have the cab service available. The distance between adjacent places is 2 Mile (3.2186 KM.), which is almost same as the equivalent area we see while booking a cab on mobile applications (on default zoom level).</p>

<div id='availability-map' style="height:400px;"></div>

<p>Although this is biased because it represent only a single day of activity but it gives us a little overview of the situation. I&#39;m not that familier with the places in the bangalore but I found an interesting thing, maybe a native resident can confirm this.</p>

<p>See those two circles at the top of the rectangle, they are too far from the main localities but we have the service there. Those circles contains places like <em>Rajanukunte</em>, <em>Doddajala</em>, <em>Chikkajala</em> etc. On googling their name, you will get comparatively more listings about property/real-estate business compared to other areas in the city.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the scenario we had with <em>Delhi - Gurgaon</em> some time back, those places are under <em>Industrialization</em>. Which makes it a good reason to have the taxi services availability, no matter some famous places around the city doesn&#39;t have this cab service, like the <em>Bannerghatta National Park</em>.</p>

<h3>Guardians (Vehicles)</h3>

<p>During the day, the system spotted a total of 897 different cabs, with 4 different types.</p>

<h3>Cab Availability (according to time)</h3>

<p>What do you think about the number of cabs available at 8:30 AM and 8:30 PM? You will see that the number is more in the morning.</p>

<p>There is a theory, <em>Utilitarianism</em>. Which states that everyone wants to maximize their utility. Take the example of E-commerce. Between so many brands, sellers and customers, everyone wants to increase their benefits. For e-sellers, scheduling an online sell is just like a game of chess. Each team want to win it. (Quoted by a good person)</p>

<p>Here is how the cab availability distribution over time looks like.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bangalore-taxis/distribution.png" alt="cab-availability-distribution" title="Cab availability distribution over time"></p>

<p>I think it goes like, the probability of a taxi being hired is high during the morning when people are going to the office/college, then it decreases during the noon-time, increases again during the 4 PM - 6 PM window when people are going back home or going out for their evening gig, and decreses in the night.</p>

<p>This is how drivers play their part as per <em>Utilitarianism</em>, which reflects in the number of available taxis.</p>

<h3>Rise of the Guardians (Vehicles)</h3>

<p>In the responses I got for the cab search requests, there was a field representing a timestamp, constant for a particular cab. Initially when I saw that, I thought it&#39;s the last time a cab was booked but it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>5 out of the 897 total cabs have that field equal to 1, which translates to January 1, 1970. This indicates that initially the field wasn&#39;t part of their architecture, but later they adopted it.</p>

<p>The uniqueness and time range of all those fields strongly supports that it was the time when a cab got associated with the organization. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/bangalore-taxis/timeline.png" alt="cab-timeline" title="Cab timeline"></p>

<p>Horizontal scale for this graph is cropped because almost 85+ % events belongs to the year 2015 itself. Which seems a bit weird, but it&#39;s what it&#39;s.</p>

<h3>Cabs around the city throughout the day</h3>

<div id='map' style="height:400px;">
    <span id='info' class='info' style='padding:10px;background:#fff;position:relative;top:17px;right:-50px;z-index:100;'></span>
</div>

<p>This particular map represents the geographic view of the <em>cab availability</em> (according to time) diagram. Where total cabs at a time are distributed accross the city according to their actual positions.</p>

<p>Now if you are thinking about the places where most of the cabs are, I have created another map for that, scroll down.  </p>

<h3>Cab Availability Index</h3>

<p>This map is somewhat inspired from the Housing&#39;s <a href="https://housing.com/blog/2013/11/14/launching-child-friendliness-index-heat-maps/">Child Friendly Index</a>.</p>

<p>It uses those equally seperated circles to count total cabs in them throughout the day, and uses the relative percentage as the opacity of each circle.</p>

<p>Neighbourhoods having maximum availability index are mostly in the <em>northern-western</em> and a little <em>central</em> part of the bangalore. Which consists of some big educational institutes as <em>Indian Institute of Science</em>, <em>Bangalore University</em>, <em>R.V. College of Engineering</em>, some famous tourist spots as <em>Lalbagh Botanical Garden</em> to contribute to the higher availability density.</p>

<p>Along with that, reports shows that <em>northern-western</em> bangalore has maximum population density in the city. Check out these images (<a href="http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/biodiversity/pubs/ETR/ETR55/Population%20Density.jpg" target="_blank">latest</a> and <a href="http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/biodiversity/pubs/ces_tr/TR118_SPoonancha/Index1_clip_image002_0000.jpg" target="_blank">old</a>) from <em>Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc</em> for the reference.</p>

<h3>Cab that travelled the most</h3>

<p>As I have told you that initially I&#39;d misread a timestamp field as the time when a cab was last hired. Writing a precise (almost) algorithm to find the path travelled by cab using current/past location and the last booking time would have been easy that way.</p>

<p>In the currecnt implementation, I have used the locations between adjacent appearances of a cab to find the approximate distance travelled by the vehicle. It assumes that the cab travelled from position A to position B despite being sufficient time difference between both appearances.</p>

<h3>Is this all fake, just like Uber illusion?</h3>

<p>Do you remember those <em>phantom car</em> stories of Uber?</p>

<p>There was a research which revealed that Uber shows a mirage of tiny black cabs moving around you, when you do a cab search. Just to convince you that a cab is there for you. Study concluded that the cab network you see around, is not real-time.</p>

<p>I wanted to analyse the <em>traffic status</em> using the response data I had. My objective was to find the regression in the <em>cab response time</em> (time taken by a cab to reach you) and <em>time of the day</em>. Because the sixth sense says that the <em>cab response time</em> should be high when there is <em>high traffic</em> in some areas of the city, likely in those peek hours (morning and evening time).</p>

<p>The <em>cab response time</em> seems to be dependant on the distance only, which looks like a <em>step function</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bangalore-taxis/restime.png" alt="cab-response-time" title="Cab Response Time"></p>

<p>I realised that there wasn&#39;t any fluctuation in the <em>response time</em>, it was same for a particular distance between the cab and the user (simulated), all the day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which implies that similar to Uber, this cab network isn&#39;t real-time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A nice explanation of the <em>phantom cars</em> is available <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/Ubers-phantom-cabs?update">here</a>.</p>

<h3>People don&#39;t solve a problem until they get one</h3>

<p>Let me insert a story here.</p>

<p>It was my first day of the recent intern. I was sitting along at my place, waiting for someone to join me or at least talk to me. Then I started reading Myntra&#39;s engineering blog to kill my time. The very first post was from the React fame <em>Sunil Pai</em>, <a href="http://myntra.github.io/2015/05/17/personal-thoughts-on-the-shutdown-of-the-myntra-website/">Personal thoughts on the shutdown of the myntra.com website</a>.</p>

<p>There was this phrase that caught my attention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine being DDOSed by every mobile device on the planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Voila, I got my work. I designed a <em>reverse proxy</em> based layer to detect the DDoS. I&#39;m still not sure that if it would have worked or not, but doing that was exciting.</p>

<p>And then I showed the solution to my manager. He ignored it, right on my face, without even listening to me.</p>

<p>Maybe because he wasn&#39;t really facing such problem (DDoS) that time, it wasn&#39;t in the roadmap there. But they will have to work on it when they will face an attack.</p>

<p>Similarly, this simulated user interaction is wrong to the system. Can be easily converted into a <em>service denial</em>.</p>

<p>In my case, I was changing the user(simulated) location frequently, so fast that a human can&#39;t reach there in a fraction of second (traversing whole Bangalore in 3 minutes).</p>

<p>If the service allows a user to book a cab for someone else (who is far away from where the real user is), the monitoring system should take care of the conversion rates. Someone trying to book a cab for someone else this fast, then not booking a single cab, and then repeating this every 15 minute all the day is a plain pattern to detect. Which should be detected. I hope somebody will fix this.</p>

<hr>

<p>That&#39;s it, get out of the cab now.</p>

<p>I have decided not to release the collected data and code for the data retrieval. Everything else including the data processing part can be found at <a href="https://github.com/pravj">pravj/bangalore-taxis</a> repository. Thanks to <em>RethinkDB</em> and <em>Mapbox</em>, you guys are really amazing.</p>
