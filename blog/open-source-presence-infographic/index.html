  <p>Technically speaking, organizations used in this report are no more only a <em>startup</em> now, but I hope you people won&#39;t mind this and aren&#39;t gonna launch a drone on me.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>I think, <em>something</em> is clear from the name itself, is it? Well! it should.</p>

<p>This report tries to plot all the involved organizations on the Open-Source portal. It tries to tell that, in the race to achieve their goals, what different organizations are doing there, for/in the community.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty biased though, because this report uses only one platform of the Open-Source community, GitHub.</p>

<p><em>This report doesn&#39;t measure the success of involved organizations; it simply can&#39;t. They all are doing good in their fields, that&#39;s why they are here.</em> <img src="/public/smileys/tophat.png" title=":tophat:" height="20px" width="20px" style="display:inline;margin:0;vertical-align:middle"/></p>

<h2>Motive</h2>

<p>I think it was almost mid of the December last year when I saw the <a href="http://yourstory.com/2014/12/techie-tuesdays-amod-malviya-cto-flipkart/">interview</a> of Flipkart&#39;s CTO <em>Amod Malviya</em> in a YourStory article. I started reading that and kept reading till the end. At the end my reaction was, <em>wow! this man is awesome</em> and he is indeed. I have seen many of his talks after reading that interview.</p>

<p>That interview made a different impression on me. I liked his words where he was talking about building a top class internet infrastructure in India. I don&#39;t know what you people think of Flipkart, Myntra etc. but what I think is that they are evolving continuously, at least in the technical aspect. That&#39;s why they are in the marathon and Amazon itself is in the race with them. </p>

<p>So, after a while I found myself on the GitHub organization of Flipkart and I was scrolling through their projects there. Then the idea of this report popped-up in my mind and here I&#39;m, struggling with it.</p>

<h2>For What Joy? Is there a need?</h2>

<p>The earth will keep rotating without this report but it&#39;s kinda necessary for technical organizations to be a part of current Open-Source era. I mean as they say in the <em>Group Dynamics</em>, If you&#39;re part of a group then you learn for other members and they learn from you.</p>

<p>Do you remember something named Facebook? Lets take an example from them.</p>

<p>Maybe that you take PHP as <em>a language for the kids</em> but keep in mind that <em>The Social Network</em> was initially developed in that same PHP. But as they started growing and feeling glitch using it; seeing that the <img src="/public/smileys/santa.png" title=":santa:" height="20px" width="20px" style="display:inline;margin:0;vertical-align:middle"/> was not coming to help them, they attempted building something on their own. Finally today, we know the inventions as <a href="http://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a> and <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack language</a>.</p>

<p>So, the thing is <em>don&#39;t wait for santa and build cool things that matters</em>. Big organizations are already doing it, be it <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm">hhvm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">react</a> by Facebook or <a href="https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js">typeahead.js</a> by Twitter or <a href="https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit">web-starter-kit</a> by Google and many more by others.</p>

<h2>Involved Organizations</h2>

<p>I do believe that the organization selection part was a bit biased as I wanted to have my favorite organizations first on the list, like HackerEarth, Hasgeek, Housing, Flipkart, Wingify and Zomato etc.</p>

<p>It was disappointing to see that Housing was not on the GitHub by that time and Zomato&#39;s organization was having zero public activities.</p>

<p>Finally, I selected 15 startups, giving priority to my favorite ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cucumbertown.com/">Cucumbertown</a> - Follow great cooks, showcase your cooking, build a following</li>
<li><a href="http://exotel.in/">Exotel</a> - Reliable Cloud Telephony System for your business</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flipkart.com/">Flipkart</a> - Online Shopping India</li>
<li><a href="http://freshdesk.com/">Freshdesk</a> - Online customer support software and helpdesk solution</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hackerearth.com/">HackerEarth</a> - Programming challenges and Developer jobs</li>
<li><a href="https://hasgeek.com/">HasGeek</a> - HasGeek organises events for geeks</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instamojo.com/v2/">Instamojo</a> - Easiest Way to Collect Payments Online</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myntra.com/">Myntra</a> - Online Shopping India</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mysmartprice.com/">MySmartPrice</a> - Compare the best prices from online retailers</li>
<li><a href="https://www.practo.com/">Practo</a> - Find Best Doctors and Book Appointments Online</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shephertz.com/">ShepHertz</a> - Complete Cloud Ecosystem for App/Game Developers</li>
<li><a href="https://www.urbanladder.com/">Urban Ladder</a> - Furniture Online Shopping Store</li>
<li><a href="http://webengage.com/">WebEngage</a> - On-Site Customer Engagement Suite</li>
<li><a href="https://wingify.com/">Wingify</a> - Website Optimization tools that simply work</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zomato.com/">Zomato</a> - Discover great places to eat around you</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a section here in this report, which uses last year&#39;s GitHub activity of organizations, so I killed my idea of replacing Zomato by someone else as the year was gone and it was kinda tough to jump traditional API <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/#participation">bumper</a> and collect data.</p>

<p>As I said Zomato have zero public activity last year but it doesn&#39;t mean they are not good, they are doing pretty good; aquiring it all, at a rate of hurricane wind speed and serving in cities more than you&#39;ve ever been in your life. Maybe they are using some other platform, a local Git hosting or something.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>You better zoom-in the images or open them in a different tab.</em></p>

<h2>1. Appearance Timeline of Organizations</h2>

<p>Do you know, when all of these organizations were found? Not sure?</p>

<p><img src="//pravj.github.io/assets/ospi/appearance-timeline.png" alt="Apperance-Timeline"></p>

<p>This plot shows <em>relative appearance</em> of selected organizations both in the public world as well as in the open-source world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Add legend text in the image.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I didn&#39;t know that Myntra was founded a bit earlier than Flipkart, who <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Flipkart-acquires-Myntra/articleshow/35472797.cms">aquired</a> the older player recently.</li>
<li>Myntra and Flipkart came in existance before the GitHub itself.</li>
<li>We can see a large gap between apperance on these two portals for Flipkart, Myntra and Zomato, Myntra being the slowest one to join.</li>
<li>Some organizations like Instamojo, HackerEarth and HasGeek felt the need of time and took no significant time in this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well! in case if you&#39;re thinking that this information is all chatter, let me present something interesting.</p>

<p>Go back and see the image carefully and you&#39;ll notice something different from others for Cucumbertown and HasGeek.</p>

<p>Yes! the GitHub organizations for these two were created before their public launching itself. <em>Sounds interesting, right?</em></p>

<p>I can&#39;t say for Cucumbertown now but I can present a supporting theory to prove this for the HasGeek.</p>

<p>Do you guys remeber what was the first event that HasGeek organised? It was <a href="http://wiki.hasgeek.in/DocType_HTML5">DocType HTML5</a>, you silly. The event was held on October, 2010 and HasGeek was pubilcally launched in December, 2010. You can fly to their GitHub account and check that they are developing <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/doctypehtml5">hasgeek/doctypehtml5</a> since then.</p>

<p>Maybe organising this event was the inspiration behind launching the HasGeek, I need to hear HasGeek founder <a href="https://twitter.com/jackerhack">Kiran</a>&#39;s words on it, though.</p>

<h2>2. Repository Status</h2>

<p>As we all know, repository is an important component of GitHub&#39;s ecosystem.</p>

<h3>2.1. Public Repository Status</h3>

<p>This section deals with no. of public repositories for each involved organization.
<img src="//pravj.github.io/assets/ospi/repository-status.png" alt="Public-Repository-Count"></p>

<p>Cloud services provider ShepHertz has maximum no. of public repositories there, mainly based on their <em>App42</em> service stack. Flipkart and HasGeek also have significant no. of repositories, rest are the organizations are building their store gradually.</p>

<p>No. of repositories on GitHub is not the right thing to measure about, though.</p>

<h3>2.2. Stars Distribution</h3>

<p>As I said, having more number of repositories doesn&#39;t explicitly show your popularity. It&#39;s not an old wars between states where king with more elephants was supposed to be the winner.</p>

<p>But no. of stars on any GitHub repository can represent its vogue, <em>leave the case where they&#39;re fake.</em>
<img src="//pravj.github.io/assets/ospi/stars-distribution.png" alt="Stars-Distribution"></p>

<p>This graph represents the stars distribution on all the repositories of involved organizations.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wingify/please.js">wingify/please.js</a> &#183; 211 &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/flipkart/hostdb">flipkart/HostDB</a> 190 &#183; &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/myntra/MYNStickyFlowLayout">myntra/MYNStickyFlowLayout</a> &#183; 133 &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wingify/dom-comparator">wingify/dom-comparator</a> &#183; 129 &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/lastuser">hasgeek/lastuser</a> &#183; 113 &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/flipkart/phantom">flipkart/phantom</a> &#183; 71 &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/hasjob">hasgeek/hasjob</a> &#183; 70 &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wingify/agentredrabbit">wingify/agentredrabbit</a> &#183; 49 &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wingify/lua-resty-rabbitmqstomp">wingify/lua-resty-rabbitmqstomp</a> &#183; 45 &#x2606;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hackerearth/hackerearth.vim">hackerearth/hackerearth.vim</a> &#183; 28 &#x2606;</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see Wingify, Flipkart and HasGeek are ruling the leader-board here.</p>

<h3>2.3. Relative Repository Attributes</h3>

<p>GitHub provides a feature named <em>fork</em>, using that you can contribute to awesome projects of others like it was your own project.</p>

<p>This section deals with attributes of repositories, counting which one of them is a <em>forked</em> repository or which one is a <em>source</em> repository.
<img src="//pravj.github.io/assets/ospi/repository-attributes.png" alt="Repository-Attributes"></p>

<p>This plot shows which organization have all their own <em>source</em> repositories and which one is having <em>forked</em> repositories.</p>

<p>During the development, I also calculated <em>active</em> and <em>inactive</em> percentage of the <em>forked</em> repositories. You can have a look <a href="https://github.com/pravj/ospi/blob/master/Terms-and-conditions.md#section-7">here</a> at <em>how this was calculated</em>.</p>

<p>We can see that HasGeek is doing fairly good here, having more share of <em>source</em> repositories than <em>forked</em>. A large portion of Flipkart and Freshdesk&#39;s repositories are <em>inactive-forked</em>.</p>

<h2>3. Development Activity</h2>

<p>All the involved organizations have somewhat for the community; projects born as solutions of some problems, projects born in some hackathons and so on. They&#39;re gradually building things to enhance their infrastucture and market position.</p>

<h3>3.1. Repository Creation</h3>

<p>This section deals with creation of repositories of all the organizations.
<img src="//pravj.github.io/assets/ospi/repository-creation.png" alt="Repository-Creation"></p>

<ul>
<li>You can see that Urban Ladder, HasGeek and Exotel created their first repository almost at the same time of their GitHub organization creation.</li>
<li>ShepHertz, HasGeek and Flipkart have kinda continuous repository creation events through out the timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, if you think that it&#39;s <em>general knowledge</em>, then let me show you the <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>Go back and watch the image carefully and you&#39;ll notice something weird for HackerEarth, are you?</p>

<p>Yes! you see there, HackerEarth&#39;s first repository was created before creation of their GitHub organization itself. <em>How is this even possible?</em></p>

<p>Well! ladies and gentlemen, this is possible. Let me introduce a new theory in support of this.</p>

<p>HackerEarth&#39;s oldest repository in the time series is <a href="https://github.com/hackerearth/django-storages">django-storages</a>. It&#39;s the same repository, which is creating the confusion. But the fact is that this repository was initially <em>forked</em> by HackerEarth&#39;s Co-founder <em>Vivek</em> on his GitHub <a href="https://github.com/vivekp">account</a>. After the creation of a separate organization for HackerEarth, he merged that repository to the organization.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why this repository&#39;s creation date is before creation of their organization. Well! again, I need <a href="https://github.com/vivekp">Vivek</a>&#39;s approval on this.</p>

<h3>3.2. Commit Activity</h3>

<p>This section deals with the commit activity of all the organizations.
<img src="//pravj.github.io/assets/ospi/commit-activity-zoom.png" alt="Commit-Activity"></p>

<p>This plot shows weekly commit activity of all the organizations. This is pretty much mixed-up though, but this was the only plot-type in my mind at the time, when I was developing this.</p>

<p>You can see a relatively more development activity in the start of the year.</p>

<p>Flipkart development team <a href="https://github.com/Flipkart/linux">keeps</a> a <em>fork</em> of the <em>linux</em>, it&#39;s not a <em>forked repo</em> though. I removed its activities because this was making the plot even more cluttered. You can check <a href="//pravj.github.io/assets/ospi/commit-activity.png">that plot</a> also, though.</p>

<h2>4. Technology Stack</h2>

<p>Different organization are working in different fields of the technology; be it medical services, developer events, online shopping, food, cloud services, online payments etc., so they&#39;re encountering different problems in the path and managing it accordingly.</p>

<h3>4.1. Programming Languages in Production</h3>

<p>This section deals with use of different programming languages in the involved organizations&#39;s infrastructure.
<img src="//pravj.github.io/assets/ospi/language-uses.png" alt="Language-Use"></p>

<p>This plot uses colors from GitHub&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/linguist">linguist</a> for different programming languages.</p>

<p>This helps us understanding tech-stack of all the organizations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Flipkart uses Java, HasGeek uses Python, Practo uses PHP and Freshdesk uses Ruby as their major programming language.</li>
<li>Organizations have started using <em>non-traditional</em> languages like Lua, Erlang and Scala etc.</li>
<li>ShepHertz uses maximum no. of programming languages(14), in their quest to serve all <em>in-demand</em> programming language in their service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2. Field of work</h3>

<p>This section deals with the fields, different organization are working in.</p>

<p>To calculate the results, I have used <em>repository names</em> and <em>their description</em> here.
Actually I wanted to have relative sharing in fields of working of all the organizations.</p>

<p>So, initially, my plan was to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> on the <em>repository-description-text</em> corpus for <em>Topic Modeling</em>.</p>

<p>Where I had use <em>concatenated repository descriptions</em> of organizations as a <em>document</em> but then I droped this idea because of asymmetrical repository distribution. It was resulting in a corpus of 14 documents only (Zomato excluded).</p>

<p>You can have a brief knowledge about LDA, <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Then I changed the plan and moved towards <em>Naive Bayes Classifier</em> and used word frequencies only.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/pravj/ospi/tree/master/classifier">classifier</a> topic results based on probability or frequency, <a href="https://github.com/pravj/ospi/blob/master/results/">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, some of the topic results from Classifier for organizations are :</p>

<ul>
<li>Cucumbertown : <em>Django, Gearman, Email, Commit, Notifier</em></li>
<li>Exotel : <em>Audio, IVR, Music, SMS</em></li>
<li>Flipkart : <em>REST API&#39;s, MySQL, lucence, Redis, HTTP proxy, load balancer</em></li>
<li>Freshdesk : <em>Databases, Rails, API, Websockets, Socket.io, YUI, Resque</em></li>
<li>HasGeek : <em>Workshop, Lastuser, App management, TV, Job, GitHub</em></li>
<li>HackerEarth : <em>Django, API documentation and clients, extensions and editors</em></li>
<li>Instamojo : <em>API clients, Wordpress, Frameworks, Huxley</em></li>
<li>Myntra : <em>iOS, Cocoa, Android, ElasticSearch, Docker, Librato</em></li>
<li>MySmartPrice : <em>Technology Blog, Gearman workers, Cookbook</em></li>
<li>Practo : <em>OpenID, Flask, Sentry, Symfony, Raven, Mail clients, Messages</em></li>
<li>ShepHertz : <em>App42, PaaS, SDK, API clients, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis</em></li>
<li>WebEngage : <em>Message, API, Website, Speech</em></li>
<li>Wingify : <em>Angular.js, DOM, RabbitMQ, iOS, Data, Bootstrap, VWO</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Here we can see that Flipkart&#39;s stack includes things related to distributed computing, Networking, Databases on the other hand Wingify&#39;s stack includes things related to Frontend, Data, Networking.</p>

<p>So, this is it. Open Source Presence Infographic of Indian Startups. <img src="/public/smileys/octocat.png" title=":octocat:" height="20px" width="20px" style="display:inline;margin:0;vertical-align:middle"/>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re thinking that <em>santa</em> helped me in all this; then you are wrong, my friend.
I was all alone everytime, thinking about it, collecting the data, managing R source files in Rstudio, writing Python for it and all that.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re feeling that you can do <em>something</em> much more awesome than this.</p>
