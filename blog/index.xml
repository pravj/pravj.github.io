      <title>Setting up personal OKR [JFM-2021]</title>

      <description>This article describes the approach I&amp;rsquo;m following to set personal goals for myself, in the form of Objectives and Key-results (OKR).
 If you are new to OKR, scroll down to the Resources section for more details.
  A publically available worksheet for my personal OKRs for January-February-March 2021 is available here.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve worked them out in order to get a better grip on the concept by implementing them in a relatively newer setting/environment outside of the work.</description>

      <title>How to read Paul Graham&#39;s essays?</title>
      <link>https://hackpravj.com/blog/how-to-read-paul-graham-essays/</link>

      <description>Before you start reading this piece, I want to inform you that the question presented here is equivalent to a mathematical problem that has multiple possible answers. The answer depends on you; how do you arrive at one of his articles, and what are you seeking.
Sounds like a zen proverb, right?
Yes. Take my “personal” answer/solution to this question for example.
Looking in the past, most of the time I’ve found myself reading the essays when I’m sitting in MTR on my own trying to spend some time off, amidst the constant background noise of people ordering the same three items over and over.</description>

      <title>Solving Google Semantris using OpenCV and Word2Vec</title>

      <description>Hmm. Looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve played enough Semantris to reach here.
 Semantris is a set of word association games by Google that use semantic search to predict a relevant word in the game based on the player’s input.
 There are 2 modes available in the game.
ARCADE
Arcade mode requires the player to come up with associated words for certain words. You are supposed to think and enter as fast as you can before an increasing list of words fills your screen.</description>
