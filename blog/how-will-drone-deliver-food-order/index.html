      <div class="post-content">
        <p>The title looks like a good interview question. So here is the right follow-up question, <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Let’s list down the contributing factors and follow up from there.</p>
<p>Have you ever been in a situation when you’re (hungry) about to place a food order and the application is showing you <em>40+ minutes to deliver</em>? It’s a complete turn-off.</p>
<ul>
<li>You start to think of some other food item that will be delivered early.</li>
<li>You might even think of paying more if it can be delivered faster.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="available-options-and-their-limitations">Available options and their limitations</h3>
<p>You can break down your order delivery timing in the following segments (<a href="https://bytes.swiggy.com/the-swiggy-delivery-challenge-part-one-6a2abb4f82f6">reference</a>).</p>
<p><img src="../../images/how-will-drone-deliver-food-order-food-delivery-time.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Food delivery companies are already doing a lot to deliver it faster for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>They minimize the delay between <em>food getting prepared</em> and <em>it getting picked up</em> by ensuring the delivery partner/executive is already at the restaurant before it’s <em>prepared</em>.</li>
<li>I’ve wondered if they (pseudo) accept the order even before the payment is complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of optimizations at work, though not all of them are focused on <em>delivering food even faster for customers</em> (<a href="https://bytes.swiggy.com/the-swiggy-delivery-challenge-part-two-f095930816e3">reference</a>).</p>
<p>After all, there is Physics and ground reality at play, affecting how fast your food is delivered.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/how-will-drone-deliver-food-order-last-mile-time.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To tackle the first factor (<em>Distance</em>), you are only shown restaurants close enough to you.</p>
<p>Here is Swiggy celebrating their launch (circa, June 2021) that allows you to order from restaurants that are at a distance.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/how-will-drone-deliver-food-order-distance-limitation.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On a side note, <em>12 km away!</em> isn&rsquo;t tempting enough, only if they showed me a famous restaurant I was missing out on.</p>
<p>Moving on, if we consider the second factor (<em>Last-mile speed</em>), it comes down to how fast is your food (<em>and the delivery partners/executives are</em>) moving around? Let&rsquo;s visit some of the available options.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/how-will-drone-deliver-food-order-option-comparison.png" alt=""></p>
<p>How fast the traffic moves depends not just on the vehicle, but where you live. In Bangalore, the Average Commute Speed ranges between 18-21 km/hr (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/at-21-2kmph-bluru-traffic-speed-up-20-in-2-years/articleshow/73000557.cms" title="Average Commute Speed">reference</a>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, Swiggy/Zomato wants to expand the <strong>Distance(restaurant, delivery-location)</strong> so you’ve more options to choose from (eventually leading to more orders or higher average order size), but they also want to increase the Last-mile speed.</p>
<p>So that customers like you and me can have that [<em>insert your favorite food item here</em>] just as we think about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Deliverator stands tall, your pie in thirty minutes or you can have it free, take the delivery car, file a class-action suit. &mdash; Snow Crash</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if they can find a solution that ensures the Last-mile time isn&rsquo;t increasing as they increase the distance, it&rsquo;s a win-win. Drones fit somewhere here.</p>
<p>Work is already happening in this domain. Swiggy/Zomato and a few other entities have received approval to start testing <em>the way their drone will deliver your food</em>. (<a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/food-delivery-in-india-via-drones-zomato-swiggy-dunzo-can-start-testing-11591253543250.html">reference</a>)</p>
<h3 id="execution-riskschallenges">Execution risks/challenges</h3>
<p>Now that we know it will bring a legit business advantage if we can get your food to travel at a higher speed, let&rsquo;s think how will this happen?</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t continue to get Neeraj Chopra to throw your food because he will eventually have to prepare for the next Olympics.</li>
<li>Neither we can teleport the parcel, as there is no <em>public</em> AWS API for it yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many variables if we consider drone delivery as an option and the associated risks/challenges.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/how-will-drone-deliver-food-order-execution-risk.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>First-mile conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Restaurants wouldn’t want to see a lot of drones on their premises instead of visitors for dine-in. There is already discrimination against delivery partners/executives at restaurants, which shouldn’t be encouraged.</li>
<li>Restaurants will not be able to maintain a dedicated space for drones.</li>
<li>This might push Swiggy/Zomato to get cloud kitchens to adopt the new delivery method before it goes mainstream to all the other restaurants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Last-last mile conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your Last-last mile conditions aren’t that good if you have to help navigate the delivery partner/executive every time you order.
<ul>
<li><em>Yes! The same Himalayan shop building, near ICICI bank</em></li>
<li><em>No! The corner building, can you see Sri Lakshmi apartment?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And if you don’t have to guide them for every order, these conditions are all sorted for you (and I need your contact details).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vehicle safety</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a product person working on drone delivery, I do not want to lose more than 3 drones every 1000 orders, so that I can get my full monthly salary.</li>
<li>You will have to prevent drones from getting stolen or getting damaged.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public safety</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, you wouldn’t want to hit someone when the order is being delivered.</li>
<li>You and your drone will have to spend the night in jail and the food will get cold.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Government regulations</strong></p>
<p>There are many rules and regulations that you will have to adhere to as you start to utilize this new delivery method. (<a href="https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in/assets/files/UasRules.pdf">reference</a>)</p>
<h3 id="possible-workflow">Possible workflow</h3>
<p>Overall, the drone-delivery operations will follow a phase-wise approach, moving from lesser execution risk to higher execution risk (<em>considering the regulations are manageable</em>).</p>
<p><img src="../../images/how-will-drone-deliver-food-order-last-mile-conditions-execution-risk.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As covered earlier, drone delivery is just an option, <em>you just want the food delivered faster.</em></p>
<p>Similar to the existing workflow, once the food is prepared, there will be two major lags to the journey.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/how-will-drone-deliver-food-order-delivery-lags.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Restaurant to Last-mile (pre-flight)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unless there is a dedicated space (at the restaurant) for setting up and launching the drones, your food might get shipped first to a place where it can be mounted on a drone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Restaurant to Last-mile (in-flight)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This might or might not have a human-in-the-loop (someone operating a drone from home), based on the flight route.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Restaurant to Last-mile (post-flight)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you live in a posh society, the Last-mile can be your own map address with a dedicated zone for Swiggy/Zomato drones to (locate and) land.</li>
<li>Otherwise, it can be a special facility (closer to your location) operated by Swiggy/Zomato.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Last-mile to Last-last mile</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At least for a significant time (2-3 years), you shouldn’t assume a drone will ever come to your balcony. It will still be a delivery partner/executive, just that he/she will pick it from the nearest Last-mile facility.</li>
<li>But when this happens, you will get your food faster, <em>that’s for sure.</em> Don’t forget to empathize with the bunch of people that worked in the background to make that happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it seems an interesting and challenging problem to solve. And as the saying goes, <em>if you can solve it in India, you can solve it anywhere.</em></p>
<p>Looking forward to the day where the normal order would take 40 minutes but there is a faster option available, even if it&rsquo;s Neeraj Chopra throwing my food.</p>
