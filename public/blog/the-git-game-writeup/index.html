<p><code>Spoiler Alert</code></p>

<p>You should go and check this out, <a href="https://github.com/hgarc014/git-game">git-game</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice little <em>complete-a-task-and-upgrade-level</em> type of game layered on top of Git.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>It is a terminal game designed to test your knowledge of git commands. Each level in the game is a task to perform on this repo. Once you perform that task, you will be given your next task. There are a total of ten levels, each one harder than last!</em></p>

<p>I saw the reference to this game floating around in my GitHub feed yesterday. The concept is awesome as there are already <a href="http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/">many</a> online tutorial courses on the Internet that uses interactive <em>learning-with-doing</em> methods for Git.</p>

<p>According to the repository, I started the adventure with cloning the repository using <code>git clone git@github.com:hgarc014/git-game.git</code> command.</p>

<p>The <em>default branch</em> was <em>master</em> and there were only two files in repository&rsquo;s <em>working directory</em>, README.md and LICENSE.</p>

<p>I started with the README.md file and <code>cat README.md</code> revealed all its content.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should always check the README.md file for your next clue!</p>

<p>Your first task is to checkout the commit whose commit message is the answer to this question:</p>

<p>When a programmer is born, what is the first thing he/she learns to say?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well! a programmer is also a boy/girl, so first thing they do is <em>cry</em> but in the current context that thing will be <em>Hello, World!</em> :grinning:</p>

<p>Now I had to find the commit whose commit message was <em>Hello World</em>, so the command <code>git log --graph --online</code> resulted this commit history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>* 25bfa08 added information for people that don&rsquo;t know git</p>

<p>*   27e9786 Merge pull request #6 from riqpe/master</p>

<p>|</p>

<p>| * 3893960 Corrected description of difficulty progression</p>

<p>|/</p>

<p>* bc9641f updated README</p>

<p>* 9b9380b Hello World!</p>

<p>* 8cafb7c Initial commit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you see the <em>Hello World! commit</em> now? Yeah! we can represent it by HEAD~3.
As that commit is <em>directly at level 3</em> or we can say <em>great-grandparent</em> of the HEAD commit.</p>

<p>So all I needed to do was the command <code>git checkout HEAD~3</code>, doing so we&rsquo;re now done with the first task.</p>

<p>After completing the first task when the HEAD is at that particular commit, the README.md file was ready with its new task.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>git-game</p>

<p>========</p>

<p>Hello World!</p>

<p>It looks like you have some knowledge about traversing commits!</p>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s get this party started!</p>

<p>We want to get to a branch whose name is the answer to this riddle:</p>

<p>I am a creature that is smaller than man, but many times more in number.</p>

<p>In code, my appearance can be subtle and no matter where I am found, I am unwanted.</p>

<p>What am I?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy Peasy? Yeah, the answer is <em>bug</em> obviously, so lets fly to same <em>branch</em> using the <code>git checkout bug</code> command.</p>

<p>In this <em>branch</em>&rsquo;s <em>working directory</em> there were two extra files, <em>cool.cpp</em> and <em>remember</em> and the README.md was saying that :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>git-game</p>

<p>========</p>

<p>Congratulations, it looks like you found the &ldquo;bug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When you work with other programmers on the same project, bugs are bound to appear.</p>

<p>One way to create bugs is by changing code that you did not write without understanding what the code is doing.</p>

<p>Sometimes we like to blame others for introducing bugs in our code.</p>

<p>Think you can find out who introduced a bug into our file cool.cpp?</p>

<p>We think he had something to do with the development of git.</p>

<p>And from what we hear he also made a branch under his name.</p>

<p>Checkout to that branch after you find out who the culprit is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It says that there is a bug in the file <em>cool.cpp</em>, lets see.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   string mesg = &quot;Hello! Who are you?&quot;;
   string input;
   cout &lt;&lt; mesg &lt;&lt; endl;
   cin &gt;&gt; input;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Loops are fun!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
   while(1);
   string reply = &quot;Well, &quot; + input + &quot;, we hope you are having fun with our git-game!&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; reply &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah! there is one; the <em>while loop</em> will refuse the program from terminating.</p>

<p>So, who did this? Well! that&rsquo;s what we have to answer now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>git blame - Helps you finding who committed what.</p>

<p>Show what revision and author last modified each line of a file</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-git">
</code></pre>

<p>ce59bbfd (Henry Garcia      2014-12-08 18:22:35 -0800 10)    cin &gt;&gt; input;

<pre><code>
Damn! someone with a similar name to the great *Linus Torvalds* is the culprit, he wrote that buggy line in the file. OK, lets move to his *branch* as the README says, using ```git checkout LinusTorvalds2014``` command.

This time the README.md file was not explicitly directing anywhere.

</code></pre>

<h1 id="git-game">git-game</h1>

<p>Looks like you found the branch of the evil Mastermind.
Things may start to get a little more challenging&hellip;</p>

<p>The next clue you are looking for &ndash;
   is in a file you choose to ignore!</p>

<pre><code>
When I was doing this I thought may be it's pointing to that useless file named *remember* which was back there in the branch *bug*.

So I *checked-out* again to the branch *bug* and tried to find any clue in the file *remember*. Its content looked like RSA Public keys to me.

<pre><code>
I gave up after scrolling through the lengthy *remember* file and *checked-out* again to the branch *LinusTorvalds2014*.

I have a strange habit to use ```ls -a``` instead of ```ls``` to list content of a directory so I did it and Boy! there it was, hiding all this time.

Guess what? there was a file named *.gitignore* and it said :

<pre><code>
This time the answer of riddle is *Tree*, simple. Don't you know? You can *google* it any time, I did the same. :wink:

So the next thing to do was, ```git checkout tree``` and the README.md file there said :

</code></pre>

<h1 id="git-game-1">git-game</h1>

<p>Welcome to the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; branch.
Looks like good ol&rsquo; Linus modified the &ldquo;nextclue_input.cpp&rdquo; file.
Normally, when ran with the shell script &ldquo;outputclue.sh&rdquo;, the &ldquo;nextclue_input.cpp&rdquo; file would give us the next hint.</p>

<p>Maybe, you should try running the shell script with the &ldquo;nextclue_input.cpp&rdquo; file and see what happens&hellip;</p>

<p>You can run the script by running the command &ldquo;./outputclue.sh FILE&rdquo; .
If you are on Windows, it&rsquo;s okey to use <code>git-bash</code> that is installed with <a href="https://msysgit.github.io/">msysgit</a>.</p>

<pre><code>
On executing the shell script with the *nextclue_input.cpp*, printed something on the STDOUT.

</code></pre>

<p>Linus has been here&hellip;
I love messing with these amateur programmers!!
If you want some real fun, then you should try resolving a conflict between this branch (tree) and code4life.
I introduced a little bug that you should fix in the conflict. &gt;:)
After you merge these 2 files you should run the shell script again!!</p>

<p>Good Luck!!!</p>

<pre><code>
The file *outputclue.sh* is a *bash* source file and matches the *md5sum* of each word in the *nextclue_input.cpp* to a local *checksum* variable named *bug*.
It keeps asking to fix *merge conflicts* until the word matching that checksum is present in the file.

</code></pre>

<p>#!/bin/bash
if [ -z $1 ]; then
  echo &ldquo;well, someone didn&rsquo;t want to run the script with a file&hellip;&rdquo;;
  exit;
fi</p>

<p>file=$1
bug=7c85d987a917c2a555d1391426978f05
mesg=&ldquo;Linus has been here&hellip;\nI love messing with these amateur programmers!!\nIf you want some real fun, then you should try resolving a conflict between this branch (tree) and code4life.\nI introduced a little bug that you should fix in the conflict. &gt;:)\nAfter you merge these 2 files you should run the shell script again!!\n\nGood Luck!!!&rdquo;
merges=$(git log &ndash;format=%h &ndash;merges | head -1)
csum=&ldquo;md5sum&rdquo;
if [ $(echo &ldquo;$OSTYPE&rdquo; | grep darwin) ];then
    csum=&ldquo;md5&rdquo;
fi</p>

<p>if [ &ldquo;$file&rdquo; = &ldquo;nextclue_input.cpp&rdquo; ];then
  if [ ${merges} ]; then
    while read p; do
      for w in $p;do
        if [ <code>echo $w | $csum | awk '{print $1}'</code> = $bug ];then
          echo -e $mesg;
          exit;
        fi;
      done;
    done &lt; $file ;
    echo -e &ldquo;Well, congratulations!! You fixed my conflict!!\nIf you would like to continue, then you should checkout to the $(echo 90mP8ouQHsNe | tr -d &lsquo;0-9A-Z&rsquo;) branch!!\n&rdquo; ;
   else
     echo -e $mesg;
     exit;
   fi;
else
  echo &ldquo;Looks like you passed in the wrong file&rdquo;;
fi</p>

<pre><code>
I saw that the *nextclue_input.cpp* file was having a line with an *infinite while loop* and my guess was right, the *checksum* variable matched the *md5sum* of the term *while(1);*

So to fix the *merge conflict*, I did ```git merge code4life``` and removed the faulty line; It worked like a charm.

</code></pre>

<p>Well, congratulations!! You fixed my conflict!!
If you would like to continue, then you should checkout to the mouse branch!!</p>

<pre><code>
&gt; BTW! It was way more easy. As the answer branch was, mouse.
&gt;
&gt; ```$ echo 90mP8ouQHsNe | tr -d '0-9A-Z'```

When I *checked-out* to the branch *mouse*, it said :

</code></pre>

<p>nextclue_input.cpp: needs merge
error: you need to resolve your current index first</p>

<pre><code>
But you can get away without merging by *stashing the changes*, I did this with ```git add nextclue_input.cpp &amp;&amp; git stash```.
Now the README.md file in branch *mouse* said :

</code></pre>

<h1 id="git-game-2">git-game</h1>

<p>Looks like you resolved your conflict and found our branch, congrats!!</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip;it seems this branch has a file that was seen before in another branch.
Do you &ldquo;remember&rdquo; what it is?
I think this file has something to do with the next clue, but it seems to be very ugly looking.
Maybe if we compare the &ldquo;diff&rdquo;erences between this file and the file from before we&rsquo;ll know where to go next&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>
Yeah! I do remember that the file *remember* was there in the branch *bug* as I wasted 10 minutes on it.

I did ```git diff mouse bug -- remember``` to see the difference between these two files accross branches and the difference in the files was this one line :

</code></pre>

<p>-Sn The next clue is: YtrydjKsYqebDoI3h bTINUeV6 pTVY8jnK2re HRwwNy25Ps6 u0YChCo5Jtw N3xkH3G nx aGo6yQTW RVZMsf3xk tBL0sG9GAR HQbyGYdqs i6dx1fyIPGJVci
+Sn In a branch named: Henry YtrydjKsYqebDoI3h bTINUeV6 pTVY8jnK2re HRwwNy25Ps6 u0YChCo5Jtw N3xkH3G nx aGo6yQTW RVZMsf3xk tBL0sG9GAR HQbyGYdqs i6dx1fy</p>

<pre><code>
So, the next *branch* to move was *Henry*, but ```git checkout Henry``` was a trap.

On *checking-out* it said, *You are in 'detached HEAD' state*; means we were not in a *branch* but *tag*. The README.md file was saying the same.

</code></pre>

<h1 id="git-game-3">git-game</h1>

<p>Welcome to my Tag!!!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for my branch then you have gone the wrong way!!</p>

<p>How do you checkout to a branch that has the same name as a tag???
Deal with the tag first!!</p>

<pre><code>
The problem was that there was a *branch* with exactly same name as a tag, *Henry*.
So I *renamed* the *tag*, because *who knows when you're gonna need something?*

```git tag Henry-v0.1 Henry &amp;&amp; git tag -d Henry``` made a new tag pointing to old's commit and deleted the old one.

Now after *checking-out* to the branch *Henry*, the README said :

</code></pre>

<h1 id="git-game-4">git-game</h1>

<p>Welcome!! It looks like you made it to my Branch!!!
Generally you want to refrain from making tags the same name as branches, unless you have a good reason.
The tag is more like the stable release.
While the branch is more like the in progress feature, which will be added soon.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re almost done!! Excited?? Hope you are! You have one more thing to do!</p>

<p>Now its time to update the master branch, updating is really useful when you fork a repository and your forked repo starts to get behind on commits. The repository to update from is: <a href="https://github.com/drami025/git-game.git">https://github.com/drami025/git-game.git</a></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t cheat!!</p>

<pre><code>
So, according to the task, to update the *master branch* I *checked-out* to it.

With ```git remote add updater git@github.com:drami025/git-game.git``` command, I added the new *remote* to update from, as the README.md said.

Then a simple ```git pull updater master``` did rest of the work and the *master branch* was equal with the new *remote*, all updated. \o/.
