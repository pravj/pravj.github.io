      <description>In the last post, I talked about how we moved away from jQuery to Angularjs to power our single page application. To recap, the major problems with our existing code which convinced us to do a rewrite -
 The existing code was written by a team which was no longer with the project. No one on the existing team had a strong understanding of how the code worked. Without any structure, the code was extremely hard to maintain and understand.</description>

      <description>For the last couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a good deal of time on building a brand new checkout for Xcite.com. Like other ecommerce websites, our website has a conventional 3 step checkout - login/signup, delivery and finally, payment. As a part of new project our goal is to allow customers to checkout as guests i.e. without the need of creating an account with Xcite. This allows us to reduce a step for customers who just want quickly purchase something off the website and be on their way.</description>
