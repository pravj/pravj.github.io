<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year when <a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2015/12/29/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2015/">people</a> <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/2015-review/">are</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@cheeaun/2015-in-review-a55c23d2af59#.kedfupgln">writing</a> about what they accomplished in the year, sites are publishing countless <em>the-best-of</em>  <a href="http://www.themacro.com/articles/2015/12/yc-2015-reading-list/">lists</a> and the only thing I&rsquo;m left wondering seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK9bwTlAvgo">YouTube Rewind</a> is - &ldquo;How come I&rsquo;ve never heard any of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://prakhar.me/articles/2014-year-in-review/">last year</a>, I too have started this ritual of writing down key highlights of my year so that I can look back a few years from now and have a chuckle at my naiveté.</p>

<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>

<p>2015 was a <strong>great</strong> year for me on Github. I did quite a bunch of work across various projects, different technologies and overall had a blast compulsively typing the innocuous looking incantation - <code>git push</code></p>

<figure> <img src="/images/2015-githubstreak.png"> 
    <figcaption>Yay! Lots of green!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The highlight of the year, however, was my selection in Google Summer of Code 2015 and the project (called <a href="http://surveyman.github.io/">Surveyman</a>) that I worked on during the summer. Having a great mentor, an exciting problem and a chance to work on React gave me enough motivation to spend late-nights after my day-job to hack on the project for approximately 4 months non-stop!</p>

<p>The first chunk of grey blocks visible around the month of March are due to a mini-burnout that I suffered. Coupled with college admissions announcements and a major release at my <a href="http://xcite.com">workplace</a> I had no energy to hack after coming back from work. In order to recuperate, I decided to not write code on 2 days of the week - which is what you see in bottom gray boxes in April. In hindsight, it worked out well as the weekends were spent playing squash and finishing a couple of <a href="https://www.destinythegame.com/">video</a> <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/V/">games</a> that were pending on my list for quite a while. Note to self: Do try this again!</p>

<h3 id="new-tech-react-go-and-clojure">New Tech - React, Go and Clojure</h3>

<p>If 2014 was the year of Nodejs, 2015 was the year of React. Although I jumped on the React bandwagon pretty late, I got an opportunity to work on a quite a few <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=react+user%3Aprakhar1989&amp;type=Repositories&amp;ref=advsearch&amp;l=&amp;l=">fun projects</a>. From boilerplates to chrome extensions - React till now has scaled to all my needs. It feels great to have an awesome tool in my arsenal that I can wield whenever I need something done on the front-end.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year I promised myself to learn a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">Lisp</a> and that&rsquo;s how I stumbled onto Clojure. The sales pitch of offering the trifecta of expressiveness (macros), practicality (JVM) and concurrency sounded like a compelling alternative to the languages I was using for most of my day-to-day work. So roughly 365 days ago, I tried a <a href="https://github.com/prakhar1989/clj-spellchecker">small experiment</a> wherein I ported some Python code over to Clojure and came away pretty impressed. In the ensuing months, after spending a good chunk of my time working on <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4clojure</a> and a <a href="http://mooc.fi/courses/2014/clojure/index.html">mini-course</a>, I eventually started writing (but unfortunately didn&rsquo;t finish) a <a href="http://www.clojurebyexample.org/">guide</a> for others. To be honest, the only reason I decided to learn React was to get started with <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">Om</a>.</p>

<p>Long story short, little did I know that the language that I had become so fond of during the year, will eventually help me land an internship!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited to share that I&rsquo;ll be interning this summer in the beautiful city of LA with <a href="http://factual.com">Factual</a> where I&rsquo;ll be building distributed systems in Clojure!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My affair with Go is still in its very early stages. Go is an ideal candidate for building easy-to-deploy concurrent programs and that&rsquo;s what I used it for. Started initially with building a <a href="https://github.com/prakhar1989/cloud-projects/blob/master/sqstwitt/worker/worker.go">worker</a> that consumes messages from a queue, I eventually ended up writing a crawler for <a href="https://github.com/prakhar1989/bekanjoos/tree/master/crawler">bekanjoos</a> in Go as well. Overall, I think Go is a language very easy to get productive with. It is simple, has easy-to-grok concurrency primitives and produces statically compiled artifacts which are an absolute pleasure to deploy on servers. At the risk of sounding controversial - I&rsquo;d recommend that every Python / Node.js developer should give Go a try for their next backend project.</p>

<h3 id="courses-and-papers">Courses and Papers</h3>

<p>On the academic front, this year I fared better than last year. Outside of grad school, I completed two courses - <a href="/articles/big-data-with-spark/">Intro to Big Data in Spark</a> and <a href="/articles/scalable-machine-learning/">Scalable Machine Learning</a>. All wasn&rsquo;t as rosy though, I started with a couple more but had to drop out as I was unable to cope up. I plan to give these courses a second attempt in this year - let&rsquo;s hope I am more successful this time.</p>

<p>One department that I drastically need to improve in is reading technical papers. I&rsquo;m still excruciatingly slow when it comes to reading papers and even more so when I need to blog about it. My grandiose plans of <a href="/tags/distributed-systems/">blogging</a> about every distributed systems paper I read collapsed as the semester picked up pace and I started falling behind in classes. Clearly spending 20 hours on reading one paper, making notes and then writing about is not scalable. Writing <a href="https://github.com/prakhar1989/Paper-Summaries">paper summaries</a> on the other hand has been a bit easier as you expect the reader to have an idea of the paper already. The only positive aspect was that I met my goal of reading more than 15 papers spanning across cloud computing, distributed systems and information retrieval.</p>

<h3 id="personal">Personal</h3>

<p>As far as relationships go, 2015 was just fantastic. The most exciting part of joining graduate school was meeting more like-minded nerds! I made a bunch of new friends, met school friends after eons and even played host to a complete <a href="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/about/">stranger</a> for an afternoon!</p>

<p>Last year&rsquo;s post ends with me promising to get more <em>active</em>. Thankfully, having a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9eLp5kr4Hg/?taken-by=prakhar.srivastav">room</a> overlooking the picturesque <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/park-features/riverside-park/virtual-tour">Riverside Park</a> meant that I didn&rsquo;t have to work hard to fight my <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html">lizard brain</a> to stay indoors. As a result, I started <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/10955633">logging my runs</a> and eventually ended up running my <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/396309765">first 10k</a> around Central Park!</p>

<h3 id="plans-for-2016">Plans for 2016</h3>

<ul>
<li>Build a non-trivial mobile app using React Native</li>
<li>Write more Clojure(script). Publish something useful on <a href="http://clojars.org">Clojars</a></li>
<li>Blog about at least 5 more technical papers.</li>
<li>Run at least 150 miles over the course of the entire year</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to an equally productive and fun 2016! 🍻</p>
