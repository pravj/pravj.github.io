      <description>Before I start telling you the story, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do an experiment. I&amp;rsquo;ll write the summary of this post first, just to stick you around, in case you are one among the people who don&amp;rsquo;t read to the end.
tl;dr Myntra is India&amp;rsquo;s largest online fashion and lifestyle store, as they say. Which is owned by Flipkart, one of the big players in Indian E-commerce.
I found a little opening in the flow of their online movement and used it to collect some information(not private though).</description>

      <description>All right, just imagine that you have popcorn with you, because I know that you don&amp;rsquo;t have.
I decided to do this report when I was in Bangalore this summer, Sillicon Valley of India. You can observe a gob of information flowing through in such metropolitan population. People ordering/delivering meal, groceries or literally everything by online orders, people booking a vehicle and riding in no time, people booking a seat for dinner/movie and many more thing to generate the logs.</description>
