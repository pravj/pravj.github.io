      <description>Semantris is a set of word association games that use semantic search to predict a relevant word in the game based on the player&amp;rsquo;s input.
 ARCADE Arcade mode requires a player to quickly come up with associated words for certain words. You are supposed to think and type as fast as you can before an increasing list of words fills your screen.

      <description>Lets start with that old promotion rant I use all the time.
 You should have a look at puzzl, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet.
 What this is all about? This post is about development of a sliding-puzzle game I made recently, named puzzl. I refer it as an intelligent version of the classical sliding puzzle game, and I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the reason behind this. Stay awake.

What&amp;rsquo;s the buzz all about? Unfortunately, there is no buzz. This post is about development of Penticons.
