      <description>This article describes my experience contributing the first commit to the Go programming language. It might be one small step for you, but it&amp;rsquo;s one giant leap for the gopher inside me.
 Along with my experience, I will outline the article as a (beginner&amp;rsquo;s) gopher&amp;rsquo;s guide for contributing to an open source project (the Go project in this case).
I have started learning Go in the late 2014 and I was lucky enough to receive a healthy appreciation from the community for my very first project in the language.</description>

      <description>Lets start with that old promotion rant I use all the time.
 You should have a look at puzzl, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet.
 What this is all about? This post is about development of a sliding-puzzle game I made recently, named puzzl. I refer it as an intelligent version of the classical sliding puzzle game, and I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the reason behind this. Stay awake.
For What Joy?  Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s the best question.</description>

      <description>Today, it&amp;rsquo;s the day of Holi, the festival of colors in India.
  Yesterday, it was the end of our midterm exams.
  Such Time. Much Rhyme.
 During the last minutes, I decided to stop writing after matching an answer with the person sitting next to me. I was all set to run outside the hall and smell the woot! no more exams left scent in the air.</description>

      <description>Jennifer Lawrence fan, huh? It was The Hash Game by the way. Still in? Kewl.
What&amp;rsquo;s the buzz all about? Unfortunately, there is no buzz. This post is about development of Penticons.
Penticons. What? Remember those egg shaped profile pictures on Twitter? They are automaticaly linked to your profile, when you forget to upload your custom profile picture.
Different services uses different default profile pictures. For example, Quora uses this image of their co-founder Charlie Cheever.</description>

      <description>You should have a look at geopattern, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet.
 What&amp;rsquo;s the buzz all about? This blog post is about development of geopattern library in golang.
 What do you think about this my favorite colored concentric circle pattern?
geopattern. What? Umm, actually I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly why the name is geopattern but I know what it is.
It is a golang library that generates pretty image patterns.</description>
