      <description>I spent a good part of the morning going through KhanAcademy high school calculus series. Why? Well, I had a differential equation to solve.
During this week&amp;rsquo;s lecture on Gossip protocols the Prof gave an interesting challenge of solving a differential equation. Now generally, I suck at proofs and I used to be the student who directly jumps at the proofs rather than working through them on his/her own. But today was different from school days - I had no fear of exams, or pressure of deadlines or the need to quickly finish homework before it gets dark outside (which would ruin the little playtime I earned in the evenings).</description>
