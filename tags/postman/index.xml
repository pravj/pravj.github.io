      <description>Steve Klabnik, the developer at Balanced recently put up a post on the company blog talking about doing TDD for APIs where he advocates a strong case for following Test Driven Development for APIs. For a lot of companies like Balanced, Stripe, Parse etc the API is their primary product. Hence, it makes sense to have strong development and testing practices for these APIs.
TDD has taken off quite well with DHH and the ruby community strongly making claims of it solving a lot of problems and guaranteeing robust code.</description>

      <description>And finally, after working non-stop on the project for 45 days Newman is finally in beta. Newman is a command-line collection runner for Postman built fully on Node.js. Newman is my first-ever node.js project and I&amp;rsquo;m extremely glad to have got a chance to build something useful and learn a new technology.
  Newman Demo.  Node has been on my radar for quite some time given its meteoric rise and hype.</description>
