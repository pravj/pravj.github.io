      <description>Hmm. Looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve played enough Semantris to reach here.
 Semantris is a set of word association games by Google that use semantic search to predict a relevant word in the game based on the playerâ€™s input.
 There are 2 modes available in the game.
ARCADE
Arcade mode requires the player to come up with associated words for certain words. You are supposed to think and enter as fast as you can before an increasing list of words fills your screen.</description>
