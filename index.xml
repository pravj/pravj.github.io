      <description>The title looks like a good interview question. So here is the right follow-up question, Why?
Let‚Äôs list down the contributing factors and follow up from there.
Have you ever been in a situation when you‚Äôre (hungry) about to place a food order and the application is showing you 40+ minutes to deliver? It‚Äôs a complete turn-off.
 You start to think of some other food item that will be delivered early.</description>

      <guid>https://hackpravj.com/blog/automation-product-design-framework/</guid>
      <description>This article is an attempt to dissect and explain automation, and to provide a framework on how to use automation during product design.
It&amp;rsquo;s based on the paper titled, &amp;ldquo;A Model for Types and Levels of Human Interaction with Automation,&amp;rdquo; by R Parasuraman et al.
Disagreement with the definition There are many opinions on automation without understanding it fully.
Even the dictionary gets it wrong perceiving it as a binary mode of operation (either 0 or full human replacement).</description>

      <guid>https://hackpravj.com/blog/how-to-read-paul-graham-essays/</guid>
      <description>Before you start reading this piece, I want to inform you that the question presented here is equivalent to a mathematical problem that has multiple possible answers. The answer depends on you; how do you arrive at one of his articles, and what are you seeking.
Sounds like a zen proverb, right?
Yes. Take my ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù answer/solution to this question for example.
Looking in the past, most of the time I‚Äôve found myself reading the essays when I‚Äôm sitting in MTR on my own trying to spend some time off, amidst the constant background noise of people ordering the same three items over and over.</description>

      <description>Hmm. Looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve played enough Semantris to reach here.
 Semantris is a set of word association games by Google that use semantic search to predict a relevant word in the game based on the player‚Äôs input.
 There are 2 modes available in the game.
ARCADE
Arcade mode requires the player to come up with associated words for certain words. You are supposed to think and enter as fast as you can before an increasing list of words fills your screen.</description>

      <description>Realize that everything matters only as much as you want it to matter. You have a choice of deciding your priorities, rest everything doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter to you. Once you convince yourself of the non-importance of most issues, you won&amp;rsquo;t think about them much.</description>
