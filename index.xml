      <title>How to read Paul Graham&#39;s essays?</title>

      <description>Before you start reading this piece, I want to inform you that the question presented here is equivalent to a mathematical problem that has multiple possible answers. The answer depends on you; how do you arrive at one of his articles, and what are you seeking.
Sounds like a zen proverb, right?
Yes. Take my “personal” answer/solution to this question for example.
Looking in the past, most of the time I’ve found myself reading the essays when I’m sitting in MTR on my own trying to spend some time off, amidst the constant background noise of people ordering the same three items over and over.</description>

      <description>Hmm. Looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve played enough Semantris to reach here.
 Semantris is a set of word association games by Google that use semantic search to predict a relevant word in the game based on the player’s input.
 There are 2 modes available in the game.
ARCADE
Arcade mode requires the player to come up with associated words for certain words. You are supposed to think and enter as fast as you can before an increasing list of words fills your screen.</description>

      <description>Realize that everything matters only as much as you want it to matter. You have a choice of deciding your priorities, rest everything doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter to you. Once you convince yourself of the non-importance of most issues, you won&amp;rsquo;t think about them much.</description>

I received my undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee(Computer Science and Engineering, 2016).
People say that I am good at clicking pictures. I have won a Mobile Photography Competitionbut can&amp;rsquo;t show you the certificate because I have lost it.
I love painting in my free time (once in a full moon every leap year), scroll below for more details.</description>
